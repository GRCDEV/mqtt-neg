# mqtt-neg

This code is the working prototype of a near-user edge gateway with the aim to define a Fog computing node based on the integration of the MQTT architecture with DTN (Disruption Tolerant Networks) techniques to provide an higher flexibility with respect to data and computation sharing. Following the Fog Computing guidelines our proposal aims to provide a significant amount of local storage and processing (rather than using in cloud data centres), communication (rather than routing over the internet backbone), simplifying control, configuration, and management.

Our gateway interconnects groups of ``things'' packed-up together that interchange data and processing among themselves and with other groups of things. In this work we will refer to this groups as ``islands''. Examples of these islands could be a vehicle on the road with all the possible sensors and data capture devices that have installed in it, or a patient that is wearing multiple bio-signals monitoring sensors.
The core of our proposal is an  element called ``MQTT near-user edge gateway'' (also indicated as \mneg\ in the following). The basic idea is that in-island things interchange data and perform processing through the local broker but can tag generated data as of ``global'' interest. In this case, the gateway will take charge of distributing this content with other island, according to rules that can depend on specific values of the tag associated to the content or to the endpoints characteristics.
